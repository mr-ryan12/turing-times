## Abstract

Welcome to Turing Times! This is an application that allows users to view articles that are the top stories from the New York Times API. Users can click on an article card and view additional information. Users also have the option to filter their articles by making a selection in the dropdown. Enjoy!
  
## Learning Goals
- Build a fully functional application in a short amount of time.
- Mimic a take home project from an employer.

## Screenshots  

   
## Technologies 
React.js  
Cypress  
SASS  
HTML

## Setup 
  
- In your terminal, clone this repository down to your local machine by running:  
  `git clone git@github.com:mr-ryan12/turing-times.git`  
- `cd` into the `turing-times` directory
- Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
- Run `npm start` to start your local server  
- Visit `http://localhost:3000/` in your web browser
- You can close your local server at any time by pressing `CTRL + c` in the terminal window running your server

## Testing
If you would like to run the Cypress tests locally:
- In your terminal, open up a separate tab (the other one is likely running your server on `http://localhost:3000`)
- Navigate to the `turing-times` directory
- Run `npm run cypress` and the test suite should appear
- Click on the `mainPage_spec.js` file
- The test suite will start running the tests
- Stop the testing server from running by clicking the red `Stop` button

## Challenges and Wins  
It was interesting to see how I would adjust my workflow to produce an application in a short amount of time. The planning and development stages were crucial, but not as in-depth. Luckily, with some persistence, the application fully functions as intended.
